Use Keras to build up a regression-based neural network for predicting the value of a potential car sale based up a cars dataset.

This data processing refers to the post: <https://towardsdatascience.com/keras-with-r-predicting-car-sales-31f48a58bf6>

The dataset is from: <http://www.michaeljgrogan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cars.csv>

## Dataset

```{r}
(cars_dataset <- read_csv("../data-raw/cars.csv", col_names = FALSE))
as_tibble(lapply(cars_dataset, function (x) {
  return (
    (x - min(x)) /
      (max(x) - min(x))
  )
}))
```
