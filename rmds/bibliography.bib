    abstract = {A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the “scatterplot”) and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics. This
article builds on Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman (2005), describing extensions and
refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar
of graphics for R, ggplot2.},
